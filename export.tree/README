# The Transdiagnostic Connectome Project

A richly phenotyped transdiagnostic dataset with behavioral and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from 241 individuals aged 18 to 70, comprising 148 individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a broad range of psychiatric illnesses and a healthy comparison group of 93 individuals.

These data include high-resolution anatomical scans and 6 x resting-state, and 3 x task-based (2 x Stroop, 1 x Faces/Shapes) functional MRI runs. Participants completed over 50 psychological and cognitive questionnaires, as well as a semi-structured clinical interview.

Data was collected at the Brain Imaging Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT and McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA. This dataset will allow investigation into brain function and transdiagnostic psychopathology in a community sample.

### Inclusion Criteria

Participants in the study met the following inclusion criteria:

* Aged 18 to 64 years and spoke English
* No metal contraindications, no history of concussion or prior neurological problems, no color-blindness
* Prior history of affective or psychotic illness or no psychiatric history

### Exclusion criteria

Participants meeting any of the criteria listed below were excluded from the study:
* Neurological disorders
* Pervasive developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder)
* Any medical condition that increases risk for MRI (e.g., pacemaker, dental braces)
* MRI contraindications (e.g., claustrophobia pregnancy)

### Consent

Institutional Review Board approval and consent were obtained. To characterise the sample, we collected data on race/ethnicity, income, use of psychotropic medication, and family history of medical or psychiatric conditions.

### Clinical Measures Data

Relevant clinical measures can be found in the `phenotype` folder, with each measure and its items described in the relevant `_definition` .csv file. The 'qc' columns indicate quality control checks done on each measure (i.e.,  number of unanswered items by a participant.) '999' values indicate missing or skipped data.
